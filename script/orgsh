=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % orgsh --help
 % orgsh [opts]

 orgsh> _

Load an Org document:

 orgsh> loadorg --as animals --source /home/budi/animals.org
 orgsh> loadorg animals /home/budi/animals.org

Load another Org document:

 orgsh> loadorg plants ~/plants.org

See loaded objects:

 orgsh> objects
 +-----------+---------------------------+-----+
 | name      | source                    | cwd |
 +-----------+---------------------------+-----+
 | animals   | /home/budi/animals.json   | /   |
 | plants    | /home/budi/plants.org     | /   |
 +-----------+---------------------------+-----+

Dump a loaded object:

 orgsh> dumpobj animals
 ...

Browse top-level children of a tree object:

 orgsh> setcurobj plants
 orgsh> ls -l
 ...

or:

 orgsh> ls -l --obj plants
 ...

Change "directory" to view another part of the tree (from hereon, please
remember that you can set the object you want to work with with C<setcurobj>
command first, or specify the name of the object using C<--object> option):

 orgsh> cd /dog
 orgsh> ls -l

Removing nodes of a tree object:

 orgsh> rm poo*

[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] Reload an object from file (reverting all modifications):

 orgsh> reloadobj animals

[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] Save a loaded object to file:

 orgsh> saveobj animals

[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] Save a loaded object to another file:

 orgsh> saveobj animals /home/budi/animals-new.org


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility lets you navigate and manipulate in-memory Org tree objects. You
can then browse the tree as if it were a filesystem, using command like C<cd>
and C<ls>. You can prune nodes, add/modify nodes, as well as move/copy nodes
around. You can save the changes back to file.


=head1 OPTIONS

=back


=head1 COMMANDS

For now, use C<help> command, or I<command> C<--help>.


=head1 SETTINGS

Settings are configuration and regulate how the shell behaves.

=head2 output_format => str (default: C<text>)

Set output format for command results. The same formatting is used by
L<Perinci::CmdLine>. See that module or L<Perinci::Result::Format> for more
details.

=head2 debug_completion => bool (default: 0)

Whether to show debugging information when doing tab completion.

=head2 debug_time_command => bool (default: 0)

Whether to show how long a command takes.


=head1 FAQ

=head2 The prompt looks rather garbled (e.g. extra " m >" character)!

It looks to be an issue with L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>. Try installing
L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> instead.

=head2 How do I redirect output of command to files?

B<orgsh> is meant to be a simple shell, not a full-blown Unix shell. So this
feature is currently not implemented.

=head2 What about variables, aliases, looping, or $other_Unix_shell_feature?

Again, B<orgsh> is meant to be a simple shell, not a full-blown Unix shell. So
those features are currently not implemented.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 ORGSH_HISTFILE => str (default: C<~/.orgsh_history>)

Specify location of command history file. Like in shells, can be set to empty
string to disable history loading/saving.

=head2 ORGSHRC => str (default: C<~/.orgshrc>)

Specify location of settings file.


=head1 FILES

=head2 C<~/.orgsh_history>

Command history file.

=head2 C<~/.orgshrc>

Settings file (L<IOD> format).
